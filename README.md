# ImHexPatterns
This repository contains various hexpat files (ImHex Pattern Files) that I've written for a variety of purposes. Below you'll find a list of the current files in the repo. You can pick up ImHex [here](https://imhex.werwolv.net/).

## Patterns
- setfile.hexpat: Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 Set Files
- sa2cameras.hexpat: Sonic Adventure 2 Camera Files (Must be decompressed!)

## Installation
Simply download the repository (or download the individual hexpat files) and place them in your ImHex installation's patterns folder. They should appear in the list when you go to import them.
